        if we are using float it is giving error and suggest to use double
        soo there is a reason by default point values(2.3) is consider as double
        because of it's larger size double has large size and if you want losay
        i don't want to work wiht double i want float then explecitly you can use
        float bye using (5.6f) that's how we can define float value
