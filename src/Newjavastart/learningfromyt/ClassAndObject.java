        It defines properties (variables/fields) and behaviors (methods/functions).
        But by itself, a class does nothing until you create objects from it.

        What is an Object?
        An object is a real-world instance of a class.
        Think of it as the actual thing built from the blueprint.
        You use the new keyword in Java to create an object.
        A class is a plan (like a recipe).
        An object is the real thing created from that plan (like the cake baked from the recipe).
